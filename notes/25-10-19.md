# page view

What if tags were limited to 1-char and a view requiring more than 26 tags would be split into pages each of which requires at most 26 tags. A row of circle characters, one for each page, with ● for the selected page and ○ for the others could be displayed in the header to indicate the number of pages and the one displayed with the left and right cursor keys used to switch pages.

This would require a view which supported both scrolling and pages.

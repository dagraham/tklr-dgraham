# The hex color "min_hex_color" applies to urgencies in [-1.0, min_urgency].
# Hex colors for the interval [min_urgency, 1.0] are broken into "steps"
# equal steps along the gradient from "min_hex_color" to "max_hex_color".
# These colors are used for tasks in the urgency listing.

[urgency.priority]
# The "priority" urgency corresponds to the value from "1" (highest) to
# "5" (lowest) of `@p` specified in the task. E.g, with "@p 3", the value
# would correspond to the "3" entry below. Absent an entry for "@p", the
# value 0.0 is used.
# Note: "next" is treated as the maximum priority when normalizing urgency.

# In the default settings, a priority of "5" is the only one that yields
# a negative value, `-5`, and thus reduces the urgency of the task.

# The "description" urgency equals "max" if the task has an "@d" entry and
# 0.0 otherwise.

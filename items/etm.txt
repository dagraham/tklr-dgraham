@d Visit to Bruges. Wonderful lunch and canal tour via open
boat. A little lost returning, we wound up walking
though a lot of the city. Witnessed an incendent with 2
waiters chasing 2 presumed fellons down a sidewalk. The
fellons reached their car, possibly stolen, jumped in,
locked the doors and then lauched the car into the
street where it met and was abruptly stopped by a
passing bus. Some mad manuvering and then backing down
the sidewalk at high speed with pedestrians diving for
cover led to an apparent escape. Could not discover the
ultimate fate of the fellons.

@c dag
@d Exciting drive to Montpellier Airport and then on by taxi to the train station for Ellen and I. Arrived at station around noon. Ellen went off to buy another suitcase for her acquisitions and then a long wait for our 4:20p train to Paris Gare Lyon. Wonderful ride, as always, with late afternoon sun and views of Mont Vonteaux for the longest time.
Taxi along Seine with conversational driver to hotel near the Arc de Triump. Very rude consierge at hotel, tiny room and bath. Toilet with perhaps 8 inches of knee room. No internet. TV has maybe 6 channels but the BBC world news is among them. Wonderful marche with cheese, wine, mustard, ..., and chocalat (thanks Pete) just next to the hotel.

@d First day in Paris. Walked to Coker/Smithwick hotel, then to the Champs Elise via a circuitous route and finally to the Musee D'Orce which had an 1.5 hour line. We punted on that and moved back to the other side of the river to the Musee de L'Orange. Another line - Ellen and I persisted but the others left. Wonderful show with dozens of Renoir, Picaso, Utillo, ... After show we walked down the Seine to have a sidewalk lunch with a view of St. Chapelle. Then down to Notre Dame and back up the other side to Rue de Rivolle. Awful! Beggars are gone but cheap shops and crowded. No sign of Hotel Brittany. Reached the Place de la Concorde and the Champs from there to the Arc de Triump was completely jammed with an extremely noisy fete celebrating France's Carribean connections. All black, agressive and somewhat scarry. We couldn't cross to the other side and were eventually forced to detour even further to the right before we could finally turn back to the Arc de Triump and finally to our hotel. Pooped and aching, we eventually recovered enough to have dinner at a nearby bistro. Homeless were bedding down along both sides of Avenue Victor Hugo for the 3 blocks we walked to the bistro.

% Stop and look
@c dag
@d Stop and look at a beautiful flower. Take a moment and simply bring your attention to it. Do not think about it but simply perceive it, to hold it in your awareness. That flower is connected to the ground as well as the sky; its life and beauty depend on both. That flower is connected to the unimaginably small minerals and nutrients in the soil as well as the vast super spectrum of its place in the mountains. It is connected to the rain that fell yesterday and the bees that will visit tomorrow. It is connected to all the other flowers in the same field. Some are barely budding, while others have already begun wilting; its beauty is fleeting. It’s also connected to time. It was once a seed, and soon enough it will wither and die, melting back into the earth.

% book club recording secretary
@c dag
@d Duties:
Before the next meeting (not this time, but in the future)
1. Send out a brief and timely review of the previous meeting.
2. Let us know what our next selection and author is. Also the meeting place.
3. At the turning of the month, send out an email reminding folks about #2
4. On the Friday before our meeting send out another reminder. (you don't have stick to the letter of #3 and #4, but folks appreciate reminders.)
At the meeting
1. Call group to order on time
2. Read any notices from the head GC book club coordinator, or other notices you have been sent or feel are of interest to readers. Keep it short.
3. Remind folks of the next selection and author and leader. Ask for a host (you may do this at the end of the evening as a way to wind up if you like)
4. Be mindful of the time and when we start repeating or searching for something to say, wind up with a thank-you to the leader and host. Oft as not the leader will do this.
Do not hesitate to ask for someone to take over when you can't make it. Come up with any format you think appropriate for our August meeting, which will be our annual pot luck dinner and offering our candidates for the new reading year. Beware of changing dates when someone can't make a meeting. My rule is that if the change is convenient to every single member then go ahead. If it interferes with one member, then we should stick to our third Monday schedule. You may wish to ask in August if we still have the paperback rule. You may also wish to ask if we can accommodate any new members. Or you may wish to let those dogs lie.

% What the tide could bring - Castaway
@s 2012-07-29 12:00
@z US/Eastern
@c dag
@i personal/quotations
@d I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to. I had
power over nothing. That's when this feeling came over
me like a warm blanket. I knew, somehow, that I had to
stay alive. Somehow. I had to keep breathing. Even
though there was no reason to hope. And all my logic
said that I would never see this place again. So that's
what I did. I stayed alive. I kept breathing. And one
day that logic was proven all wrong because the tide
came in and gave me a sail. And now, here I am. I'm
back. In Memphis, talking to you. I have ice in my
glass. And I've lost her all over again. I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that she was
with me on that island. And I know what I have to do
now. I gotta keep breathing, because tomorrow the sun
will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.

% When to the sessions - Shakespeare #30
@c dag
@d When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight:
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.

% That time of year - Shakespeare
@c dag
@d That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west;
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
   This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
   To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

% Do not go gentle - Dylan Thomas
@c dag
@d .
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rage at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

@t quotes
@d Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts speaking at his
son’s middle-school graduation, June 3:
From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will
be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the
value of justice.
I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will
teach you the importance of loyalty.
Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to
time so that you don’t take friends for granted.
I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that
you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and
understand that your success is not completely deserved
and that the failure of others is not completely
deserved either.
And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope
every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your
failure. It is a way for you to understand the
importance of sportsmanship.
I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of
listening to others, and I hope you will have just
enough pain to learn compassion.
Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to
happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will
depend upon your ability to see the message in your
misfortunes.

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

@i personal/quotations
@d If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

@i personal/quotations
@d Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

@d Let me take this other glove off
As the vox humana swells,
And the beauteous fields of Eden
Bask beneath the Abbey bells.
Here, where England's statesmen lie,
Listen to a lady's cry.
Gracious Lord, oh bomb the Germans.
Spare their women for Thy Sake,
And if that is not too easy
We will pardon Thy Mistake.
But, gracious Lord, whate'er shall be,
Don't let anyone bomb me.
Keep our Empire undismembered
Guide our Forces by Thy Hand,
Gallant blacks from far Jamaica,
Honduras and Togoland;
Protect them Lord in all their fights,
And, even more, protect the whites.
Think of what our Nation stands for,
Books from Boots and country lanes,
Free speech, free passes, class distinction,
Democracy and proper drains.
Lord, put beneath Thy special care
One-eighty-nine Cadogan Square.
Although dear Lord I am a sinner,
I have done no major crime;
Now I'll come to Evening Service
Whensoever I have the time.
So, Lord, reserve for me a crown.
And do not let my shares go down.
I will labour for Thy Kingdom,
Help our lads to win the war,
Send white feathers to the cowards
Join the Women's Army Corps,
Then wash the Steps around Thy Throne
In the Eternal Safety Zone.
Now I feel a little better,
What a treat to hear Thy Word,
Where the bones of leading statesmen,
Have so often been interr'd.
And now, dear Lord, I cannot wait
Because I have a luncheon date.

% 16Th Avenue
@i personal/quotations
@d Recorded by Lacy J. Dalton
Written by Thom Schuyler
From the corners of the country from the cities and the farms
With years and years of living tucked up underneath their arms
They walked away from everything just to see a dream come true
So God bless the boys who make the noise on 16th Av-enue

With a million dollar spirit and an old flat top guitar
They drive to town with all they own in a hundred dollar car
Cause one time someone told them about a friend of a friend they knew
Who owns you know a studio on 16th Av-enue

Now some are born to money they never had to say survive
And others swing a nine pound hammer just to stay alive
There's cowboys drunks and Christians mostly white and black and blue
They've all dialed the phone collect to home from 16th Av-enue

Ah but then one night in some empty room where no curtains ever hung
Like a miracle some golden words roll off of someone's tongue
And after years of being nothing they're all looking right at you
And there for awhile they'll go in style on 16th Av-enue

Hey it looks so uneventful so quiet and discreet
But a lot of lives were changed there on that little one-way street
Cause they walked away from everything just to see a dream come true
So God bless the boys who make the noise on 16th Av-enue

% Nutrition advice
@s 2020-07-31 08:37
@d from Ellen Lawrence
1) Fasting - do NOT skip breakfast. Breakfast should be the largest meal of the day with fat and protein. E.g., add almond slivers to cereal. Dinner should be early, over by 7pm, and relatively light.
2) Belly fat - aging converts muscle to fat. Add protein to diet and do strength training exercise to combat this.
3) Health Line (on line) is a great source for health information.

% Group Riding Tips
@s 2020-09-08 08:18
@d Group Riding: Tips for the Leader

1. Try to stay away from rights on red -unless you are going to wait down the road.

2. At a stop sign do go just because you can – wait for most of your group to  come close realizing that you might get through before the next car but the last man might not.

3. If you make a road change after a stop sign do not return to full speed until a mile or so down so the guys at tail can catch up.

4. If we are doing the twisties realize that each of us slows down going in and speeds up coming out and that this will leave a little more distance between us – so again do not go right to full speed until everyone has had a chance to catch up

5, If you plan to go more then the speed limit by 5 mph the last guy will hav  to go 10 mph over to catch up. Not bad on straight away but tough on curves and for sure a thing to avoid in areas, like Corinth, that are likely to have speed traps.

6. If you start to see the guy behind you really hanging back, he is probably trying to signal that someone behind has not yet caught up. Slow down until he closes up and you can see more of the group.

@d Arrived around 4pm after pleasant trip save for worries about running out of gas. Chilly and breezy Wednesday evening. Dined on microwave from SunBasket and enjoyed sunset. Retired inside about 8pm with the arrival of stronger winds and rain. Rain continued until early afternoon on Thursday. Our first extended hang out indoors time and it was cozy and wonderful. Opted for a late lunch at the diner across the road. Fried oysters for me - as good as I ever had - combined with some local IPAs. Wonderful walk on beach late afternoon with sunshine but strong winds now reaching 30mph. Abby was beside herself with joy dashing around on the beach. Returned to diner for pie, Ellen, and another IPA for me. Then a wonderful camp fire accompanied by dropping temperatures and steady, near gale force winds. Retreated to the warmth of Tabitha around 8pm. Both heat and hot water worked perfectly. Friday morning the real-feel in the 20's with the still near gale force wind. Too cold to be outside for long so no walks. Hung out until about noon and then decided to pack up and head home.
We met several wonderful families including a young couple who were both middle school teachers in Chapel Hill. Every RVer we meet seems remarkably nice. Altogether a great trip despite the wind and cold.

@d Our maiden voyage for Tabitha. Camped in C-10, a lovely, relatively private spot on the water. Wonderful camp fires both Thursday and Friday evenings with meals from SunBasket and entertainment from a heron couple and, of course, Abby. Late breakfast Thusday at Verlie's in Pittsboro where we arrived at 11am just in time for breakfast. Yummmm - we showed no restraint. Then back by home to pick up various forgotten items and then back to C-10. Saturday morning we had a fairly long walk on the trail that connects the loops. Then packed up and dropped Tabitha back at "Between the Lakes". By the time we got home I was pooped and I think Ellen was as well.

   to make the wounded whole,

   to heal the sin-sick soul.

   Sometimes I feel discouraged
   and think my work's in vain,
   but then the Holy Spirit
   revives my soul again.

   If you cannot preach like Peter,

@s 2021-12-07
@d I, Tree: A Green Story
as told to Daniel Graham

I am an ordinary tree, a White Oak to be precise, but in all relevant aspects I am similar to other trees and, indeed, to plants in general. This is my story of what it really means to be “Green”.

Many people might think that my life is an easy one that requires little or no effort to “earn a living”. I am here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. Take sunlight, for example. Think I just stand here and soak it up? No, I go to a great deal of trouble to arrange my leaves in just such a way as to maximize their exposure to sunlight. And since the relative position of the sun changes during the course of the day, this work is continuous. Over the longer term, I also go to the trouble of growing new branches in promising locations and dropping branches in less favorable ones.

Procuring water requires similar effort. I need to arrange my roots, for example, so that their tips are just under the ends of my branches since that is where the drip from rain fall on my leaves is most concentrated. Obtaining the water is just the beginning since I need to deliver it to my leaves which average 60 feet above the ground. Think pumping water up 60 feet is easy?

With water in my leaves and sunlight upon them, there is one task remaining and perhaps the biggest one of all: getting food. You might think that I get food from my roots but you would be wrong. Yes, I get Nitrogen and some minerals from my roots but Carbon is the food I need. To get it I use tiny little mouths on my leaves to collect carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then separate the needed Carbon. That’s right, I eat carbon dioxide to get the Carbon I need to stay alive!

Getting this carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is not easy. The little mouths on my leaves that I use to eat the carbon dioxide, unfortunately let water molecules, that I also need, escape. Life if full of trade-offs. The more mouths I have on my leaves, the more water I need from my roots. Of course, what I really need is not mouths but carbon dioxide. So more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would mean that I need fewer mouths and with fewer mouths, less water. Win, win for more carbon dioxide!

Now if you heard from someone that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, it certainly wasn’t from a plant or, for that matter, from any person in the business of growing plants. Greenhouse operators, for example, commonly burn propane, let the heat escape and pipe the exhaust which is rich in carbon dioxide into their greenhouses to the great appreciation of all the plants residing therein.

You might say that this is all fine for plants but what about people? Now it is important to remember that plants are the basis, directly or indirectly, for all life on Earth, so our interests in this are not opposed. Still, the question remains, how much carbon dioxide is enough? Some rough benchmarks for carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere all in PPM (parts per million):
	•	150: plants starve
	•	180: 1740ad (end of last “mini” ice age)
	•	280: 1800ad (beginning of industrical revolution)
	•	400: average current reported concentration
	•	1000: greenhouses
	•	1700: filled auditorium
	•	4000: Cambrian period (500 million years ago)
	•	5000: max allowed in a US Navy submarine
	•	7000: max allowed in NASA spaceflight

So, if you ask me, I would say that 1000ppm or about 250% of the current concentration would be “truly green”. This would still only be about 25% of what my ancestors enjoyed and only 20% of what the US Navy thinks is safe for their submarine crew members.

I think that claiming to be “green” and a “carbon hater” is, at least, an oxymoron. But then, I am only a tree.

@i personal/quotations
@d Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

@d We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.

@d This takes about 1h - just do it!!! Try Linking USB accounts to TurboTax. Otherwise upload 1099R's using the account numbers (3L07132 and 3L07133) and the 11-character document id's from UBS 1099R pdfs inside Turbo Tax.  Not worth itemizing interest and other deductions - $10,000 or so short of the standard deduction.

@d ...So, let us not be blind to our differences — but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.

@d But the thing worth doing, well done
has a shape that satisfies,
clean and evident.
​Greek amphoras for wine or oil.
Hopey vases that held corn
are put in museums
​but you know they were made to be used.
​The pitcher cries for water to carry
and a person for work that is real.
